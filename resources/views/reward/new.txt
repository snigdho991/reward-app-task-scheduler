What does re allow 
From Me to Everyone 02:27 AM
Re-allow photo means when a user come to the app he/she gets a "allow permission to all photos" pop up. But if he/she enables it from this settings, then he/she doesn't need to allow it again whenever he/she will enter the app.

And just to clarify….the trash icon deletes the picture and the save icon keeps the picture?
From Me to Everyone 02:29 AM
Correct. You are completely right.

Does the seconds between buckets automatically set to 30 seconds and then the user changes it to 0-5 seconds?
Things that need to be updated:
1. Install an “undo” feature to get an image back if we want
2. Change graphic image on the login page
The user swipes left or right to keep image, correct?
I think there needs to be an arrow pointing right or left to show users how to work it.

Select photos should send users to another screen that gives options (date, time, etc)
For example….if the user picks “select photos” they would have an option to choose photos from a particular date
Is that an option?

I understand. But will it redirect to the user's phone gallery?
From Karen Daugherty to Everyone 02:48 AM
It could be a particular date (like March 2022) or a particular place (Italy 2022). I think “select photos” should pull up an option to choose a date/place and then it would redirect to the users photo gallery based on what they chose
Here’s an option. The date/location could be a simple like it could be “photos from the last 30 days” instead of March 2022
